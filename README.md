# Deno Ground

Pet project to try out a bit of Deno by building an Emoji API with it, in-memory built with iterators, simple route "interpreters", somewhat loosely using the concept of a contentNegotiator, a fun thing.

## Steps to Run
- Make sure you have Deno
- Clone the repository
  - SSH `git clone git@github.com:karudedios/deno_ground.git`
  - HTTPS `git clone https://github.com/karudedios/deno_ground.git`
- `cd deno_ground`
- `deno --allow-net --allow-env index.ts`
  - You can omit the two flags, and just run `deno index.ts` or `deno run index.ts`, it's going to ask you for permissions for network and environment before allowing anything to happen.

## Cheers

That's all there is to this (at least as far as I can see and have thought about), so have a good one. üçª
